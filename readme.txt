WooCommerce RRP allows users to add text before the regular price and sale price of a product from within WooCommerce General settings.

== Description ==

WooCommerce RRP allows a users to add text before the regular price and sale price of a product from within WooCommerce General settings. You can also select to have this text displayed on archive templates by simply clicking a select box.

If you would like to change the display text for a certain product, you can use the [WordPress add filter function](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter "Function Reference/add filter"), please see the FAQ for an example.

Ideally I would have been able to release WooCommerce RRP with translations, this was not the case, so if you would like to add a translation I and others would greatly appreciate it.

If you have suggestions for new features, please add your idea in the "Support" area for this plugin.

If WooCommerce RRP has made your life a little easier, please leave a positive review in the "Reviews" area for this plugin.

** Requires WooCommerce to be installed. **

== Installation ==

1. Upload WooCommerce RRP to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to WooCommerce > Settings and add your text to the input areas in "Currency Options". See Screenshots for a visual explanation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I want to change the "Product Price Text" for a certain product? =

This can be done using the built in [WordPress add filter function](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter "Function Reference/add filter"). For example, if we had a product with an id of 96 and we wanted to change the text of the "Product Price Text" field to "Your new Product Price Text", the function would like this:

`
function change_before_regular_price( $woo_rrp_before_price ) {
	global $post;
	if ( '96' == $post->ID ) :
		return 'Your new Product Price Text';
	else :
		return $woo_rrp_before_price;
	endif;
}
add_filter( 'woo_rrp_before_price', 'change_before_regular_price' );
`

= What if I want to change the "Sale Price Text" for a certain product? =

This can be done using the built in WordPress add filter function. For example, if we had a product with an id of 96 and we wanted to change the text of the "Sale Price Text" field to "Your new Sale Price Text, the function would like this:
`
function change_before_sale_price( $woo_rrp_before_sale_price ) {
	global $post;
	if ( '96' == $post->ID ) :
		return 'Your new Sale Price Text';
	else :
		return $woo_rrp_before_sale_price;
	endif;
}
add_filter( 'woo_rrp_before_sale_price', 'change_before_sale_price' );
`

= Can you provide a list of filters that are available and a description of what they control? =

Sure, there are two filters available for you to use:

* woo_rrp_before_price - Controls the text that is displayed before the regular price of a product.
* woo_rrp_before_sale_price - Controls the text that is displayed before the sale price of a product.

= Enabling the "Show Text On Archives" messes up the archive display, can you please fix this? =

No, You will need to tidy this up yourself using a little CSS styling.

= There isn't any translations of this plugin, can I provide you a translation in my local language to include? =

Sure, that would be awesome!
